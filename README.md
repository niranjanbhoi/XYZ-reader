# XYZ Reader - Make Your App Material

## Overview
Redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app

The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.
My job is to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

### User Feedback for XYZ Reader:
Lyla says:
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

Jay says:
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

Kagure says:
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”

## What will I learn
Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.
